# Setting up CBS-M
 1) Download and install the VPK, if you have an older version of CBS/CBS-M please remove/uninstall it first.
 2) Open the newly installed app, it will install CBSM to enso's boot_config and taihen's config.txt.
 3) Reboot
 4) Go to Settings->Theme & Background, there should be a new entry: "Boot Screen". That's it!
 
# Usage
